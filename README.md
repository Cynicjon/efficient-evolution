# Efficient evolution from general protein language models

Scripts for running the analysis described in the paper ["Efficient evolution of human antibodies from general protein language models and sequence information alone"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.10.487811v1).

### Running the model

To evaluate the model on a new sequence, clone this repository and run
```bash
python bin/recommend.py [sequence]
```
where `[sequence]` is the wildtype protein sequence you want to evolve. The script will output a list of substitutions and the number of recommending language models.

To recommend mutations to antibody variable domain sequences, we have simply run the above script separately on the heavy and light chain sequences.

### Paper analysis scripts

To reproduce the analysis in the paper, first download and extract data with the commands:
```bash
wget https://zenodo.org/record/6968342/files/data.tar.gz
tar xvf data.tar.gz
```

To acquire mutations to a given antibody, run the command
```bash
bash bin/eval_models.sh [antibody_name]
```
where `[antibody_name]` is one of `medi8852`, `medi_uca`, `mab114`, `mab114_uca`, `s309`, `regn10987`, or `c143`.

DMS experiments can be run with the command
```bash
bash bin/dms.sh
```
